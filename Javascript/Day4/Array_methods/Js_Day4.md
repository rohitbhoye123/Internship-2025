#  Every Method


   The every() method is an iterative method. It calls a provided 
callbackFn function once for each element in an array, until the 
callbackFn returns a falsy value. If such an element is found, 
every() immediately returns false and stops iterating through the
 array.

#  fill Method 


   he fill() method fills specified elements in an array with a 
   value. The fill() method overwrites the original array. Start 
   and end position can be specified. If not, all elements will be 
   filled.

# some method

What does some () do in JavaScript?

element in the array passes the test implemented by the provided
 function. It returns true if, in the array, it finds an element 
 for which the provided function returns true; otherwise it returns
  false. It doesn't modify the array.
